This is Conway's game of life, entirely in command prompt!

in this folder you will notice a savefile.txt. This is your starting board.
the first line is the width and height respectively.
the second line is the symbol to be used for alive/dead cells respectively.
the rest of the document is the game board, with O's representing alive cells
and X's representing dead cells. modify it however you like, but be sure to 
follow the format and match the width and height exactly!
